### Recommended Process

Split your time into thirds (rough; not enforced; adjust as necessary for longer projects):

- _Ideation_ &#x2013; What do you want to express and why? Note: this comes before form/technique/technology.
- _Definition_ &#x2013; What it is; form. Ensure form suits idea.
- _Action_ &#x2013; Make it; impact the world.

### Course Description

Quarantine has changed the shape of performance in many parts of the world and especially the United States, forcing the performing arts to figure out how to survive &#x2013; creatively and financially &#x2013; without physically-present audiences. This workshop will explore how we can create performance in an online format and will explore the vocabulary, technique, opportunities and challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration as an active creative process.

The specific focus and application during this intensive will be the question of how we relate to the world around us—as it represents itself in sensory and tactile form—through the virtual world of the internet. The hope is that new ideas and vocabulary will emerge from the engagement of artists in process-oriented disciplines rather than the goal of a finished product. The collaboratively intensive course will use both the iterative/prototyping methods of art and the rehearsal based narrative explorations of Drama in new experimental methods.

Both in creation and performance, we will attempt to reflect, juxtapose, and critically investigate the way the "real" and "virtual" world shape our perceptions and how we can embody real performance in a virtual context.

The above may include work of Fine Artists, Design Technologists, Conceptual Artists, Game Designers, Animators, Fashion Designers, Architects, Fabricators, Actors, Writers, Directors, Musicians and Filmmaker/Videographers.

### Learning Outcomes

We will begin the course with an introduction to some of the techniques of the theatre, becoming familiar with our bodies through vocal and movement exercises. Following this, we will spend three days creating three experiments designed to bring an aspect of the performance experience to bear in an online format. The final day, groups will create a work that responds to the past four days of work in a new format.

1. EXPLAIN/ARTICULATE IDEAS
2. MAKE/BUILD WITH A NEW SKILL
3. COMMUNICATE COLLABORATIVELY
4. Document the process of making the work.
5. Explore different methods of storytelling.
6. Explore and develop new ways to structure collaboration.
7. Embrace the unknown; accept that work is fluid & organic; commit to an idea in progress.
8. Create presence and performance in the virtual.
9. Apply performance principles to art-based work.
10. Apply art principles to performance.
11. Create theatrical installations, performance art, and video.
12. Learn how to use the above processes in your future practice.
