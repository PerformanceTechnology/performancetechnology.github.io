Make a phrase using 3-5 words from the image. You can add connecting words, like prepositions, "and", etc (these do not count towards the word limit). You can add punctuation. Focus on quality. 

Try brainstorming phrases during the first five or so minutes, then choose one you like and refine it during the remaining minutes.
