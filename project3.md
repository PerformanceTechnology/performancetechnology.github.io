### Performance Prompt

Consider the phrase your group has been assigned. Remember the notes you had regarding the performance you saw on Sunday based on that phrase. Take those notes -- how you felt, what you thought (about the piece, about the interpretation of the phrase, etc), and turn them into a new performance. It doesn't need to be a critique; think about the pieces as being in concert or in dialogue with each other.
