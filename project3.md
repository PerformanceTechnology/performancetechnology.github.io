### Performance Prompt

Consider the phrase your group has been assigned on its own. Remember the notes you had regarding the performance you saw from another group based on that phrase. Take those notes -- how you felt, what you thought (about the piece, about the interpretation of the phrase, etc), and turn them into a new performance. It doesn't need to be a critique; think about the pieces as being in concert or in dialogue with each other.
