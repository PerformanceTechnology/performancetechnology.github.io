The 2021 Performance And Technology class invites you to an open workshop to see pieces in progress on Zoom this Friday, January 15, at 5PM EST. This interdisciplinary group of artists spent the week creating a series of experimental performances responding to the constraints and affordances of the online venue.

Workshops will run from 5-6PM; a recording for latecomers will play from 6-7PM.
